categorical (not make sense do linear regression on categorical data)
ordinal (there is ordering but no absolute scale, like between 1 and 2 may not same as 2 and 3)
interval (distance between things are meaningful)
ratio (distance matters and absolute values matter)

descriptive statistics:
    mean 
    std dev / variance
    median
    order statistics (quartile, ... ?)

gaussian / normal:
    bell curve: probability density function, integrate it can do calculation
    cumulative distribution function, if greater than 1 ?

berboulli distribution:
    coin flip

binomial distribution:
    how many heads in n coin flips

the above two are discrete discrete not continuous
    some continuous stuff?

hypothesis testing:
    p value 

linear regression:
    least square regression:
        define erri = ||yi - prediction(xi)||^2            i is subscriptor
        finding parmeters that minimize sigmal(erri)
        y = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + b3*x3 + b4*x4 + b5*sqrt(x3)*x4^2?  b is greek beita
        but cannot add e^(b4*x1)
        r-square = 1 - sigma(err)/var(y), close to 1 if line is perfect, 0 if bad
    p-value: determine which term is ok for the regression
    ?, scatter plot, box plot
    ? contour plot, z-value
    marks and channels (give a graph, need to know which are marks and which are channels)

classification:
    logistics(b0 + b1*x), range: 0 to 1
    ? cross-validation
    bootstrapping

clustering:
    similar to classification, but dont know the category, need to figure out the label
    k mean
    linkage criteria
