unsupervised learning:
    given x

    clustering:
        want to assign labels to each point
        want few labels
        want points with same label close together

    k-means clustering:
        min sigma[cluster c](sigma[i<-c](||pi - c||^2))

    k^n different clustering

    lloyd's algorithm/relaxation:
        pick initial cluster centers while not "converged"
        assign points to closest cluster center 
        move cluster centers to mean position of assigned points

    cd(i, c) = avg distance btw i, points in c
    a(i) = cd(i, i's cluster)
    b(i) = cd(i, i's next-closest cluster)
    silhrouette = (b(i) - a(i)) / max(b(i), a(i))

hierarchical clustering:
    bottom up
    "Agglomerative" hierarchical clustering

    put each point in a cluster 
    while > 1 cluster 
        merge 2 closest clusters

    “linkage criteria”
    how to measure distance between clusters
    take pairwise distance between points 
            in c1 / c2
    max -> "max/complete" linkage
    min -> "min/single" linkage
    mean -> "average linkage"

    "centroid linkage" -> distance (cluster centers)

    "ward" pick clusters that minimize
    sigma[cluster c](sigma[i<-c](||pi - c||))   (with ^2 ?)
